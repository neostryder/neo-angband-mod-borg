# Borg: quick reference

Angband's automatic player, ported from 4.2.6's borg/. It plays the way you do -
through the same commands, over the frozen agent API - so it is a mod like any
other rather than privileged code inside the engine.

This page is the short version: every setting, what the mod asks the game for,
and where the longer material is. The account of why each of these exists is in
[the repository README](../README.md).

## Settings

Each one is a named toggle on the game's own Mods screen, which shows the full
description. The identifier is the name a save and another mod see; where a
switch has no flag of its own, the game knows it by its section id instead.

| Setting | Identifier | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Play risky | `borg.playsRisky` | off | borg_plays_risky. Skip the early hit-point and character-level gates that hold the Borg above a depth, wait longer before drinking a cure, and back away later in a losing fight. |
| Value melee and missile damage | `borg.worshipsDamage` | off | borg_worships_damage. Add weight to weapon and bow damage when the Borg scores a set of gear, so a trade that costs armour for damage looks better than it otherwise would. |
| Value speed | `borg.worshipsSpeed` | off | borg_worships_speed. Add weight to a speed bonus when scoring gear. |
| Value hit points | `borg.worshipsHp` | off | borg_worships_hp. Add weight to constitution and hit points when scoring gear. |
| Value spell points | `borg.worshipsMana` | off | borg_worships_mana. Add weight to spell points when scoring gear. |
| Value armour class | `borg.worshipsAc` | off | borg_worships_ac. Add weight to armour class when scoring gear. |
| Value gold | `borg.worshipsGold` | off | borg_worships_gold. Sell harder, walk down rather than pay for a recall, and put off the first deep recall. |
| Save up for something it wants | `borg.selfScum` | on | borg_self_scum. Let the Borg set itself a gold target and work in town until it can afford one item it has decided it needs. |
| Skimp on stockpiles for an early munchkin run | `borg.munchkinStart` | off | borg_munchkin_start. Below character level borg_munchkin_level (12), stop valuing potions of resist poison and speed, phase door, word of recall and the deeper cure stockpiles as highly as it normally would, on the assumption that a young character is cashing out rather than settling in. |

## What it needs

- **Engine:** `>=1.1.0`
- **Shape:** `plugin`
- **Facets:** `plugin`
- **Capabilities:** `command:add`, `state:player.read`, `state:monsters.read`,
  `state:map.read`, `state:inventory.read`, `state:floor.read`,
  `state:messages.read`, `state:stores.read`, `state:spells.read`,
  `state:constants.read`

What a capability string permits, and what a mod that asks for one cannot do
without it, is in [the mod lifecycle
document](https://github.com/neostryder/neo-angband/blob/master/docs/modding/MOD_LIFECYCLE.md).
