/**
 * Borg's own RNG, isolated from the game's.
 *
 * Upstream, the borg runs its damage/attack simulations on the game's global
 * RNG but swaps in its own local seed first and restores the game's seed after
 * (reference/src/borg/borg.c:489-506), so its "what if I attacked" dry-runs
 * never advance the real game stream. This engine has no global RNG - each stream
 * is a first-class instance (core/src/rng.ts) - so the Borg simply OWNS a
 * separate generator. This preserves both invariants at once:
 *
 *  1. Game determinism, the sharpest faithfulness risk in the port: the Borg
 *     never draws from or perturbs the game's RNG.
 *  2. Borg behavior: simulations use the same quick-LCRNG the C borg used.
 *
 * THE STREAM RUNS CONTINUOUSLY FOR THE LIFE OF BORG. Upstream seeds
 * borg_rand_local exactly once, at borg start-up (borg-init.c:487-488), and the
 * swap-in/swap-out at each think ends with `borg_rand_local = Rand_value`
 * (borg.c:504) - it saves the ADVANCED value back. So think N+1 begins where
 * think N stopped. Resetting to a constant every think instead would make the
 * Nth draw of every think the same number forever: every tie-break decided the
 * same way, every low-probability branch either always taken or never taken.
 * A one-instance generator that is never reseeded reproduces upstream exactly,
 * and stays fully deterministic for a given starting seed.
 *
 * The seed is not part of the savefile. Upstream does not persist it either;
 * borg_rand_local is a process-lifetime global, re-drawn on the next start-up.
