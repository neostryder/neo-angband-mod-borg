/**
 * The Borg's own RNG, isolated from the game's.
 *
 * Upstream, the borg runs its damage/attack simulations on the game's global
 * RNG but swaps in its own local seed first and restores the game's seed after
 * (reference/src/borg/borg.c ~L481-501), so its "what if I attacked" dry-runs
 * never advance the real game stream. Our engine has no global RNG - each stream
 * is a first-class instance (core/src/rng.ts) - so the Borg simply OWNS a
 * separate generator. This preserves both invariants at once:
 *
 *  1. Game determinism (the maintainer's #1 faithfulness concern): the Borg
 *     never draws from or perturbs the game's RNG.
 *  2. Borg behavior: simulations use the same quick-LCRNG the C borg used, from
 *     a fixed local seed, so dry-run rolls are reproducible per decision.
 *
 * The Borg reseeds this generator at the start of each think (reseed()) so a
 * decision's simulations are a pure function of its inputs, exactly as the C
 * borg's seed-swap made them.
