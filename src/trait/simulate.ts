/**
 * borg.power for a loadout the Borg is NOT wearing.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHAT THE C DID
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * `borg_wear_stuff` / `borg_think_shop_buy_useful` /
 * `borg_think_shop_sell_useless` all decide by DIFFING borg.power: score the
 * character now, score it with the candidate worn or bought or sold, take the
 * better. Upstream gets the second score by wielding the candidate for real,
 * running borg_notice and borg_power over the changed struct player, and putting
 * everything back (borg-power.c, borg-item-wear.c:858).
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS INSTEAD
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * This port cannot wield anything to find out. `borgNotice` re-derives most of
 * the trait array from the ItemViews itself, but a handful of values - net speed,
 * the AC-less skills, blows, shots, max hitpoints, max mana - it takes straight
 * off the already-derived PlayerView, because those are numbers the engine has
 * already computed and re-deriving them would need race and class base tables the
 * frozen view does not carry. And the engine computed them for the loadout the
 * character is ACTUALLY in.
 *
 * So the four decisions above ran on a conservative default that reported no gain
 * from anything, and the Borg wore nothing it found, bought nothing it needed and
 * sold nothing it was done with. The ported arithmetic was correct the whole
 * time; it was being asked about a loadout nobody could describe.
 *
 * `AgentView.simulateLoadout` is the engine capability that describes one (Neo
 * Angband 0.25.0): it runs the engine's own calc_bonuses over a hypothetical set
 * of worn objects and hands back the PlayerView and the ItemViews that loadout
 * would produce. This file is the other half - run the ported borg_notice and
 * borg_power over that view instead of the live one.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY THE SHAPES ARE DECLARED HERE RATHER THAN IMPORTED
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * They are NARROWER than the engine's own, on purpose, which is why they stay
 * declared here now that the published types carry them. `LoadoutItemRef` has a
 * third arm holding a live `GameObject`, and a mod driving the frozen view never
 * holds one; `LoadoutSimulation` carries before / after / delta and this file
 * reads three fields of `after`. Declaring what is actually reachable and
 * actually read is the same choice plugin.ts makes for its ControllerCtx and
 * resolvers.ts for its registry lookups. A test asserts the two agree, so a
 * change to the engine's shapes fails this repository's build rather than
 * surfacing as bad play.
 *
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------
 * WHY THE WORLD IS SHADOWED RATHER THAN SAVED AND RESTORED
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * `borgNotice` writes `world.self.trait`, `borgPower` writes `world.self.power`,
 * and both go through the WeakMap of derived side-state keyed BY THE WORLD OBJECT
 * (trait/state.ts). Scoring a candidate on the live world would therefore leave
 * the Borg's own self-model describing an item it is not wearing, for the rest of
 * the think, and a decision ladder evaluates dozens of candidates per turn.
 * Saving the three and putting them back would work and is one early return away
 * from not working.
 *
 * Instead the simulation runs against a world whose prototype IS the live one and
 * which owns a fresh `self`. Reads fall through to the real world; the two writes
 * land on the copy; the WeakMap sees a different key and hands out a separate
 * derived block. Nothing has to be restored because nothing was touched.
