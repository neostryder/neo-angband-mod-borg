/**
 * @rpgm-tools/neo-angband-borg item subsystem (P8.5): the per-role sval identity table.
 *
 * The C borg resolves object svals by NAME at init via lookup_sval(tval, name)
 * (reference/src/borg/borg-item-val.c). @rpgm-tools/neo-angband-core exports the TV_*
 * constants (generated/tvals.ts) but does NOT export the sv_* constants, so this
 * module transcribes the canonical svals as a self-contained table.
 *
 * FIDELITY: the svals here are the 1-based file order per tval in
 * reference/lib/gamedata/object.txt, which is exactly how core assigns them
 * (ObjRegistry.bindKinds: `sval = ++base.numSvals`, obj/bind.ts:654,684). So a
 * carried ItemView.sval matches these numbers byte-for-byte with what
 * lookup_sval would have returned in the C borg. Where the C had a copy/paste
 * quirk (e.g. sv_wand_confuse_monster / sv_wand_elec_ball point at the wrong
 * kind) the quirk is preserved and noted, so behaviour is identical.
 */

/**
 * Role -> canonical sval, keyed exactly by the sv_/kv_ role name in
