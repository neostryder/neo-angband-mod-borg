/**
 * Public API of the Borg danger / threat-evaluation subsystem (P8.2), a faithful
 * port of reference/src/borg/borg-danger.c and the fear-cache updaters from
 * borg-update.c.
 *
 * Entry points:
 *  - borgDanger(ctx, y, x, turns, average, fullDamage): total danger at a grid.
 *  - borgDangerOneKill(ctx, y, x, turns, i, average, fullDamage): per-monster.
 *  - borgFearGrid / borgFearRegional: the fear-cache updaters (borg-update.c).
 *  - getDangerGlobals(world) / getFearCaches(world): the per-Borg danger state
 *    the fight/think ports set before calling borgDanger (the analog of the C
 *    file-scope globals the maneuver code toggled).
 *
 * The low-level geometry (LOS, projection, distance) and the r_info bridge
 * (MonsterFacts, the facts resolver) are exported too so callers and P8.6 can
 * wire an exact monster-race resolver without touching the damage math.
