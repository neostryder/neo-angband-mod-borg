/**
 * The player's toggles, the settings they move, and upstream's own defaults must
 * agree - all three, at build time.
 *
 * WHY THIS NEEDS A TEST. A settings surface has three halves that are edited in
 * different files on different days: a `rules` entry in manifest.json is what a
 * player sees, `RULE_CFG` in plugin.ts is what turns a flag into a setting, and
 * `defaultCfg()` in src/trait/config.ts is what the ported decision code reads
 * when nobody said otherwise. Every disagreement between them is silent:
 *
 *   - A rule with no entry in RULE_CFG is a switch in the mod manager that moves
 *     nothing. It has a title, a description and a tick, and the Borg ignores it.
 *   - An entry in RULE_CFG with no rule is a setting no player can reach.
 *   - A rule whose `default` differs from `defaultCfg()` means the menu says one
 *     thing and a Borg built with no flags at all does another - and two of these
 *     settings ship ON, so this is not a theoretical direction.
 *
 * None of the three shows up in a game that plays. So the check is derived:
 * read the manifest, read the table out of plugin.ts, and compare both against
 * the port's own defaults and against upstream's `borg_settings[]`.
