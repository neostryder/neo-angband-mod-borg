/**
 * Message-stream consumption - a faithful port of the world-model half of
 * borg_parse (reference/src/borg/borg-messages.c) and the reaction passes of
 * borg_update (reference/src/borg/borg-update.c:2770-2890).
 *
 * Upstream this is a two-stage pipeline: borg_parse turns a raw game message
 * ("The orc dies.") into a tagged reaction ("DIED:the orc") via borg_react, and
 * borg_update later resolves each reaction against the tracked monster list with
 * borg_locate_kill (nearest record whose name matches, within a distance) and
 * mutates the world model (borg_delete_kill on death, etc.). The port collapses
 * the two stages into one pass over ctx.view.messages(), which is behaviorally
 * identical, and classifies each line with the same prefix/suffix tables.
 *
 * The THREE upstream passes matter, because their order is what decides whether
 * an attack raises fear. Pass one attributes a message to a tracked monster and
 * marks it used; pass two skips every used message and adds REGIONAL FEAR for
 * what is left. So fear is what the Borg feels about an attacker it could not
 * find, which is the whole point of borg_fear_regional: its own comment says it
 * exists to keep the Borg from resting while unseen guys attack it.
 *
 * FIDELITY NOTE (fog-of-war). struct borg_kill stores no monster name (it reads
 * r_info[r_idx] on demand), so the frozen port cannot re-derive a tracked
 * record's name to match borg_locate_kill exactly. Instead a death / blink
 * message prunes the nearest tracked monster that is NOT visible this tick
 * (a visible monster is demonstrably not the one that just died/vanished),
 * within the same distances the C used (20 for death, small for blink). With
 * exact monster ids from the frozen view a dead monster already disappears from
 * view.monsters() and would expire on the 2000-turn clock regardless; consuming
 * the death message just prunes it immediately, matching upstream timing.
 *
 * For an ATTACK message the port does better than upstream rather than worse:
 * the view hands over each visible monster's own race name, so matching the
 * attacker is exact where the C guessed a race from a name and a depth score.
