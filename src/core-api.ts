/**
 * The ONE place the Borg reaches into the engine for a runtime value.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS, and it is not tidiness. The mod builder REFUSES a plugin
 * that bundles a copy of the engine: a second `@rpgm-tools/neo-angband-core`
 * inside plugin.js would give it its own registries while the game ran on
 * another set, and the two would agree right up until they did not. A mod
 * receives the live engine as `ctx.core` instead - the same module instance the
 * game is running on.
 *
 * Which meant every bare `import ... from "@rpgm-tools/neo-angband-core"` in the
 * Borg was a line that had to change on the way out of the engine repository.
 * Measured before the move: 37 files mentioned the package and **28 of those
 * were `import type`**, which compiles to nothing and could stay exactly as it
 * was. The runtime coupling was six symbols across eight files, funnelled here
 * so the extraction replaced ONE file. `core-import-census.test.ts` is what
 * keeps that true: it fails if a second file grows a value import.
 *
 * HOW THE INDIRECTION WORKS: ESM live bindings, not a Proxy. `export let` is a
 * binding importers see through, so `bindCore` reassigning FEAT here updates
 * `FEAT` at every use site, and esbuild preserves that inside the bundle. A
 * Proxy would also work and is worse: it would have to get iteration, spread and
 * `new` right for six symbols of three different kinds, and each of those is a
 * way to be subtly wrong. A reassigned variable IS the engine's own object.
 *
 * THE ONE RULE THIS IMPOSES: nothing may read these at MODULE TOP LEVEL, because
 * modules evaluate at import time and `bindCore` runs after. Measured across the
 * whole port: exactly one site did - a `const` array of TV values in
 * think-ladder.ts - and it was made lazy. `top-level-core-use.test.ts` fails if
 * a second appears, because the alternative symptom is an `undefined` read
 * somewhere inside a decision ladder.
 *
 * Type-only imports are deliberately NOT funnelled. They are erased, they cost
 * the mod nothing, and routing them through here would hide which engine types
 * each module actually speaks in.
 *
 * THE ADAPTER. This file is also the one place the Borg reads the host at all:
 * the plugin context, the registries, the live state, and the view and actions
 * a controller is handed. The exports are grouped by the API 2 domain each one
 * maps to (meta, view, truth and act). Anything with no API 2 counterpart sits
 * in the engine group, with a note on what API 2 would need for it.
 * adapter-boundary.test.ts fails when another file reads the host directly.
