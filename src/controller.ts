/**
 * The Borg controller: an AgentController (the frozen decision seam) backed by
 * the Borg's world model, private RNG, and think ladder. This is what a host
 * installs via installController to hand the game over to the Borg.
 *
 * Per-think cycle (mirrors borg_think, borg-think.c:138-467):
 *   1. advance the Borg clock exactly once and the panel clock (:446).
 *   2. borgNotice: fill self.trait[] / power inputs from the view (:453).
 *   3. perceive: fold the current view into the world model, incl. the message
 *      stream and staleness/expiry (borg_update, :456), then run borg_update's
 *      own tail - forget monsters that are demonstrably not where the Borg left
 *      them (:2902), and re-stamp the monster fear cache (:2990).
 *   4. borgPower: score the current world (:459).
 *   5. track MAXCLEVEL / MAXDEPTH and the per-level "began" clock (:438).
 *   6. prime the wiring session (danger globals, flow avoidance) and think:
 *      run the store or dungeon ladder, returning one command (or null).
 *
 * The controller is deterministic: it draws only its own private RNG, so a host
 * installs it WITHOUT nondeterministic:true and the save's determinism ratchet
 * stays untripped - a faithful, replayable autoplayer. Determinism comes from
 * the stream being private and seeded, not from restarting it: the stream runs
 * continuously across thinks, exactly as borg_rand_local does (see rng.ts).
