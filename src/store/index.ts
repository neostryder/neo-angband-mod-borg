/**
 * @rpgm-tools/neo-angband-borg stores / shopping / home subsystem (P8.7).
 *
 * A faithful port of the Angband 4.2.6 borg's shop-interaction decisions
 * (reference/src/borg/borg-store*.c, borg-think-store.c, borg-home-notice.c,
 * borg-home-power.c). The think-ladder (P8.6) drives it via:
 *   - borgThinkStore(ctx, shopNum, deps?) - the in-shop decision entry, returns
 *     the AgentCommand to execute (buy / sell / retrieve / stash / exit).
 *   - borgChooseShop(ctx, deps?) - the shop-priority ladder; sets
 *     ctx.world.self.goal.{shop,ware,item} and returns whether a goal was set.
 * plus the individual step helpers, the home valuation (borgPowerHome), and the
 * anti-loop memory (createStoreMemory).
 *
 * Power-delta seam: player-inventory power deltas are injected via StoreDeps
 * (buyShopEval / buyHomeEval / sellEval / ...), defaulting to "no gain" so the
 * borg buys/sells nothing on that path without a seam (mirrors item-wear.ts
 * wearEval / junk.ts simDrop). The home-power path is computed directly and works
 * without any seam.
 *
 * BARREL DISCIPLINE: names that live at the package root (BI, trait, distance,
 * TV, SVAL, ...) are imported internally, never re-exported here.
