/**
 * The in-shop decision tree - a faithful port of borg-think-store.c
 * (borg_choose_shop:87 and borg_think_store:286).
 *
 * borg_choose_shop is the priority ladder that decides WHICH shop to visit and
 * WHAT to do there, in the exact order the C documents (borg-think-store.c:42):
 *   1 sell to home  2 sell to shops  3 buy from shops  4 buy from home
 *   5 grab home junk 6 buy for home  7A/7B buy a home swap.
 * It sets ctx.world.self.goal (shop/ware/item) and returns a boolean, exactly as
 * the C sets borg.goal and returns bool. Sentinel -1 = "no goal".
 *
 * borg_think_store is the per-think entry the ladder (P8.6) calls once the borg
 * is physically inside a shop: it runs borg_choose_shop, then tries to act on the
 * goal via the sell/buy verbs, and otherwise leaves. It returns the AgentCommand
 * to execute this think (or shopExit).
 *
 * OUT OF SCOPE here (handled by the ladder BEFORE store logic in the C): the
 * borg_best_stuff / borg_wear_stuff equipment optimisation at the top of
 * borg_think_store:308-318, and the borg_notice(true) refresh - both belong to
 * the P8.5 item/wear and P8.3 trait subsystems and are driven by the caller.
