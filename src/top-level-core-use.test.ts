/**
 * No engine value may be read at MODULE TOP LEVEL.
 *
 * core-api.ts hands out FEAT, TV, RSF, Rng and the two flag tables as ESM live
 * bindings that `bindCore` fills from `ctx.core`. Modules evaluate at import
 * time and bindCore runs after, so anything that reads one of those at module
 * scope captures `undefined` - permanently, because a `const` is evaluated once.
 *
 * WHY THIS NEEDS A TEST RATHER THAN CARE. The failure is silent in every way
 * that matters. It does not throw: `undefined` is a fine thing to put in an
 * array. It does not fail a typecheck: the types say the values are there. It
 * does not fail at load: the plugin installs and reports success. It surfaces as
 * the Borg making inexplicable decisions - a `WEAPON_TVALS` of four undefineds
 * simply means "you are not holding a weapon", forever, and the ladder below it
 * behaves consistently and wrongly.
 *
 * Exactly one site had this problem when the port moved, and it was that array.
 *
 * The scan is deliberately crude - brace depth, and a name match - because the
 * alternative is a TypeScript AST walk in a repository whose only compiler use
 * is `tsc --noEmit`. It over-reports rather than under-reports: a false positive
 * is a comment away, a false negative is the bug above.
