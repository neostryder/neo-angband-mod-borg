/**
 * Per-Borg mutable state for the combat/defense/escape cluster - the faithful
 * analog of the file-scope globals the C fight code read and wrote while it
 * "simulated then committed" a maneuver (reference/src/borg/borg-fight-attack.c,
 * borg-fight-defend.c, borg-escape.c).
 *
 * Upstream these are true globals:
 *   - borg_simulate            (borg.h): dry-run vs commit flag
 *   - borg_temp_x/y/n          (borg-flow.c): the near-monster scratch list
 *     borg_attack rebuilds and reads within a single call
 *   - successful_target        (borg-fight-attack.c): shot-tracking state
 *   - target_closest           (borg-fight-attack.c)
 *   - borg_tp_other_*          (borg-fight-attack.c): Teleport-Other exclusion
 *     list (the indices live in the danger globals so borg_danger reads them)
 *   - borg_fighting_unique     (borg-flow-kill.c): 0 none, 1..8 uniques, >=10
 *     Morgoth/questor; drives most escape/defend thresholds
 *   - borg_t_antisummon, borg_began (borg-flow.c): anti-loop timers
 *
 * The C keypress side effects (borg_keypress / borg_target) are replaced by the
 * perceive/act contract: an aux function, when committing (simulate=false),
 * stores the resulting AgentCommand on `pending` (and sets targets via ctx.act),
 * which the orchestrator (borgAttack/borgDefend) then returns. This preserves
 * the exact two-phase "simulate all, pick best, run best for real" pattern.
 *
 * Bundled per BorgWorld via a WeakMap so multiple Borgs / tests stay isolated,
 * exactly as danger/state.ts does for the danger globals.
