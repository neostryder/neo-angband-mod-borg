/**
 * `package.json` and `manifest.json` must carry the same version.
 *
 * The game reads `manifest.json`, so that is the version a player installs and
 * the one a release tag matches. `package.json` is only what the build and the
 * toolchain see, which is exactly why it can drift without anything noticing:
 * in the qol mod it sat at 1.1.1 through the 1.2.0, 1.3.0 and 1.4.0 releases,
 * three tags out of date, and nothing failed.
 *
 * The changelog is the third site, and the one with the longest reach. A
 * version whose section is undated is a release nobody can read the notes for,
 * and The Ledger builds every entry from that section, so a missing one is a
 * version that reaches the site as nothing at all.
